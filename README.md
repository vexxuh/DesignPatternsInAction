# DesignPatternsInAction
Design pattern project meant to use basic to advanced patterns. This Project is meant for a knowledge showcase mainly for an architectural perspective.   


# Introduction: 

This project is meant to serve as a learning tool for myself and others who want to see the architectual design patterns in action. 
As of this moment the main patterns that will be used are from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable 
Object-Oriented Software" by The Gang Of Four. This project hopes to be a good learning tool for myself and other to see design patterns in action.

The main point is to create use-cases and determine what pattern fits these use-cases. This document is meant to be/serve as a project that will help devs and
architects to see these patterns and learn of their use in a very direct format. 


# Project Summary:

The application that will be created is going to be a console application using Java ONLY. Everything that will be presented and used is meant to be a 
data center that contains and hold information about anything. The application will have the purpose of holding information about anything. And can be
customized to any users needs. 

# Application Breakdown - Core Features

The core features of this application will be as follows. 
- An in-memory database that can be converted to excel. The application can also take in a excel file and convert it back to a in-memory database as well. 
- Provides a GUI interface for users of the software to interact with features.

(This section is subject to change at anytime with new or changing core features as the application grows)

# Project Structure Breakdown

This project will have two parts. One will be an architectual folder which contains PlantUML graphics as well as the needed text files to explain each pattern and how it is used in code. The second part will contain the actual Java code used to execute the design. Not only will this project contain these high-level documents but it will also provide information related to the use-case diagrams and test plan documents for each part of the systems. All folders are labled with each pattern. If something is not clear PLEASE CREATE AN ISSUE. I can clarify and go into great detail.
